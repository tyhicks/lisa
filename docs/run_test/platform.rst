Run on Azure
------------

VM can be deployed on Azure using images from vhd, shared image
gallery or marketplace. If multiple types are specified, the first
non-empty type is picked in the following order :
vhd, shared image gallery and marketplace.

Use vhd
^^^^^^^

To run using vhd, add the following to runbook :

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            vhd: "<VHD URL>"
            hyperv_generation: <1 or 2>

The ``<VHD URL>`` can either be a SAS url or a blob url. If it is a SAS url, the image is copied to the resource group: ``lisa_shared_resource``, storage
account: ``lisat{location}{subscription_id[last 8 digits]}`` and container:
``lisa-sas-copied`` in the subscription used to run LISA, which could potentially
increase the runtime. The copied VHD has to be manually deleted by the user.

If the selected VM Size's Hypervisor Generation is '2', hyperv_generation
parameter is necessary, and should be specified as 2.

Use marketplace image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run using marketplace image, add the following to runbook:

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            marketplace: "<Publisher> <Offer> <Sku> <Version>"

Running using shared image gallery ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ To run
using shared image gallery, add the following to runbook if the shared image
gallery is in the same subscription that is used to run LISA :

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            shared_gallery: "<image_gallery>/<image_definition>/<image_version>"

If the shared image gallery is in a different subscription, ``subscription_id``
needs to be specified. Ensure that the credential used to run LISA has access to
the shared image gallery.

.. code:: yaml

   platform:
   - type: azure
      ...
      requirement:
         ...
         azure:
            ...
            shared_gallery: "<subscription_id>/<image_gallery>/<image_definition>/<image_version>"

The remaining steps are same as outlined in
:doc:`Getting started with Azure <quick_run>`.

Running with existing deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to deploying a new Azure server and running tests, you can skip the
deployment phase and use existing resource group.

The advantage is that it can run all test cases of Azure. The shortage is that
the VM name is fixed, and it should be node-0, so each resource group can put
only one VM.

Run on Hyper-V
---------------

LISA uses SSH to communicate with Windows server to operate Hyper-V.

`Enable-SSH.ps1
<https://github.com/microsoft/lisa/tree/main/microsoft/utils/Enable-SSH.ps1>`_
is used to enable SSH with key authentication, when use a Windows server in
first time. Follow below steps to use this script.


Run on Ready computers
----------------------

If you have prepared a Linux computer for testing, please run LISA with
``ready`` runbook:

1. Get the IP address of your computer for testing.

2. Get the SSH public/private key pair which can access this computer.

3. Run LISA with parameters below:

   .. code:: bash

      lisa -r ./microsoft/runbook/ready.yml -v public_address:<public address> -v "user_name:<user name>" -v "admin_private_key_file:<private key file>"

The advantage is it’s not related to any infra. The shortage is that,
some test cases won’t run in Ready platform, for example, test cases
cannot get serial log from a VM directly.

``ready`` runbook also supports tests which require multiple computers (for
example, networking testing); and, it supports password authentication too.
Learn more from :doc:`runbook reference <runbook>`.

For a comprehensive introduction to LISA supported test parameters and runbook
schema, please read :doc:`command-line reference <command_line>` and
:doc:`runbook reference <runbook>`.
